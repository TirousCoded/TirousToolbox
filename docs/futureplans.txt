 -- TIROUS TOOLBOX LIBRARY FUTURE PLANS --


	A quick-little rundown of things I'd like to do with this library in the future.

	This document will be liberally added-to and removed-from as needed.


 -- FUTURE PLANS --


	- cleanup our source code so it's more readable by people other than just me

	- use compiler-specific macro stuff to automate the setup of TT_CONFIG_* definitions

	- rewrite the API so that it can handle compilation for pre-C++17 code, which is not universal,
	  with the Unreal Engine, as just one example, using C++14

	- rewrite the API to use C-style header guards, for (vary rare) cases where the end-user
	  doesn't have access to #pragma once

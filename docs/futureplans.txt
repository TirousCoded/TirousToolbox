 -- TIROUS TOOLBOX LIBRARY FUTURE PLANS --


	A quick-little rundown of things I'd like to do with this library in the future.

	This document will be liberally added-to and removed-from as needed.


 Future Plans


	- Cleanup our source code so it's more readable by people other than just me.

	- Use compiler-specific macro stuff to automate the setup of TT_CONFIG_* definitions.

	- Rewrite the API so that it can handle compilation for pre-C++17 code, which is not universal.

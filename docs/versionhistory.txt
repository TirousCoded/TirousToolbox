 -- TIROUS TOOLBOX LIBRARY VERSION HISTORY --


	The Tirous Toolbox library operates upon a strict 'MAJOR.MINOR' based
	versioning system.

	MINOR level updates are additions to the library, alongside potentially a few
	vary small removals or modifications, however these ladder two are to be done
	on a VARY conservative basis, ensuring *reasonable* backwards compatibility.

	MAJOR level updates involve major additions, removals, and modifications to 
	the library, with no promise of backwards compatibility.


Version 0.0 (September 26th, 2021)


	- Began development of the Tirous Toolbox library.


Version 1.0 (November 22nd, 2021)


	- Finished development of the initial version of the Tirous Toolbox library.


Version 1.1 (November 25th, 2021)


	- Removed the 'patch' level from the project's version number, as *releasing* a 
	  new *version* for EVERY tiny bug fix would be SUPER annoying...

	- Fixed a billion tiny errors, mostly regarding header file X requiring something
	  from header file Y, but not including Y yet.


Version 1.2 (November 26th, 2021)


	- The library uses a single global variable for its shared pointer implementation.

	  To this end, in order to fix linkage problems that arose from this, naive on my
	  part, usage of global variables, a notion of a 'home source file' has been defined
	  in order for the library to be setup correctly.

	  See docs/crashcourse.txt for details.


Version 2.0 (March 3rd, 2022)


	- Major library revision following (...the failure of) my latest project, with me 
	  releasing this update in preparation for my next project (which is attempt #2, lol.)

	- Mostly just library removals, actually, with me cleaning out a lot of old stuff
	  that never actually ended up being useful.

	- Removed ALL *fancy pointer* stuff, including the library's custom scoped and shared
	  pointer implementations, which turned out to just be inferior versions to the 
	  standard library ones, with me never ending-up using them.

	- Completely removed the above *home source file* notion from the library, due to the
	  removal of the above fancy pointer stuff, and thus the stray global variable which
	  forced the creation of the home source file system to make the library compile.

	- Completely removed aliases like tt::vector and tt::hash_map, which were aliases
	  of things like std::vector and std::unordered_map, because they only added complexity,
	  and were never actually used.

	- Changes the 'visualize' function of the library's string visualization system to now
	  be the 'vis' function. This change was made due to how the word 'visualize' made a
	  bunch of string function names overly long, which ended up feeling gross.

	- Added tt_wchar, tt_char16 and tt_char32 versions of the contents of tt/character_arrays.h, 
	  which turned out to be pretty useful, but which weren't added yet.

	- Added tt::fs as an alias of std::filesystem, to tt/file.h.

	- Added tt_uintptr and tt_intptr.

	- General code cleanup, reorganizing, and refactoring, with a billion minor changes 
	  here-and-there with everything else in the library alongside the above.

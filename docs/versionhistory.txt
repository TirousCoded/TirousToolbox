 -- TIROUS TOOLBOX LIBRARY VERSION HISTORY --


	The Tirous Toolbox library operates upon a strict 'MAJOR.MINOR' based
	versioning system.

	MINOR level updates are additions to the library, alongside potentially a few
	vary small removals or modifications, however these ladder two are to be done
	on a VARY conservative basis, ensuring *reasonable* backwards compatibility.

	MAJOR level updates involve major additions, removals, and modifications to 
	the library, with no promise of backwards compatibility.


Version 0.0 (September 26th, 2021)


	- Began development of the Tirous Toolbox library.


Version 1.0 (November 22nd, 2021)


	- Finished development of the initial version of the Tirous Toolbox library.


Version 1.1 (November 25th, 2021)


	- Removed the 'patch' level from the project's version number, as *releasing* a 
	  new *version* for EVERY tiny bug fix would be SUPER annoying...

	- Fixed a billion tiny errors, mostly regarding header file X requiring something
	  from header file Y, but not including Y yet.

# The TirousToolbox Library

The TirousToolbox library is my personal, header-only, extension library to the C++ standard library.

It provides a bunch of useful everyday tools which I personally use in all of my projects, and thus which I've brought together under one roof.

# Setup & Documentation

The library is a simple header-only library, so no complex linkage or cmake stuff to worry about.

See "docs/crashcourse.txt" for a quick rundown of the library, what it provides, how to set it up, and how to configure it.

There's not currently a full-on manual, nor a wiki, but I hope that this quick crashcourse.txt will provide enough information to start using the library without too much confusion.
